            <p>The aim here is to show, with a <strong>map</strong>, the evolution of the mortgage default in the United States during the <strong>2008 financial crisis</strong>.</p>
            <p>Features : There will be a map of the United States, with the evolution of the mortgage default over time. We'll use a slider to change the date of the data, so the map will change, but we could also place a play button to go through the dates smoothly. We will also be able to change the metric of the map, so we can see the evolution of the mortgage default, the unemployment rate, ...</p>
            <p>Here we'll use : a json file for the data (Lecture 4), <strong>D3.js</strong> to create map (Lecture 4, Lecture 8), 
                and some <strong>user interactions</strong> (Lecture 5) like a slider to change the date of the data, or the ability to click on a state to see the evolution of the number of mortgage default of this specific state.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Those two visualization will allow the user to get a broad view of the scale of the financial institutions around the world. The first one is a <strong>dynamic world map</strong> that shows the major financial institutions acquired or bankrupt around the world due to the financial crisis, with the size of the bubbles proportional to the cumulative size of the transactions in this country. After sliding to the right twice, past an analysis of the map, the user will have access to another visualization with a <strong>bar chart</strong> of the USA regional bank collapse number.</p>
            <p>Features : The user will be able to see either the evolution of the propogation automatically or move in time with a slider. It will also be able to click on the bubble to see details / facts on the transactions in this country. On the bar chart, the user will be able to see the number of failure by hovering its mouse on the bars.</p>
            <p>We will use a csv file for the data (Lecture 4) and <strong>D3 and Leaflet</strong> to create a map with interactions like zooming, clicking on the bubbles,etc. (Lecture 5). For the bar chart, we will eventually partition the data to have a more interesting bar charts, maybe with different colors for the size of the bank, if there was an acquirer or no, etc. (Lecture 5) </p>

            <p>The aim here is to show, with a <strong>word cloud</strong>, the search trends on Google in the United States, in order to highlight the population fear about <strong>2008 financial crisis</strong>.</p>
            <p>Features : There will be a word cloud of the (for e.g. 100) most searched words in the United States. To interact with the word cloud, we'll use a slider to change the date of the data, so the world cloud will change, but we could also place a play button to go through the dates smoothly.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Here we'll use : <strong>Google Trends API</strong> to get the data and save it as a json file (Lecture 4), 
                <strong>D3.js</strong> to create the word cloud (Lecture 4), 
                and some <strong>user interactions</strong> (Lecture 5) like a slider to change the date of the data, or the ability to click on a word to see the evolution of the word over time.</p>
